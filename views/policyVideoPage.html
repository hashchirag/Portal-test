            <h1>A. Instant Lessons</h1>
            <p>HashLearn is a tutoring platform that helps students clear concepts and solve
                doubts around questions that they struggle with. Our goal is to help the student
                learn by providing the best on-demand, tutoring experience.</p>
            <p>
                To achieve this goal and to maintain high standards of engagement on
                our platform, there are do's and don'ts to be followed as a tutor broadly defined
                under three key areas - Subject Knowledge, Communication, Speed and Accuracy.
            </p>

        <section class="content-block">
            <h2 class="smallerheader">1. Subject Knowledge</h2>
            <p>While we appreciate that you understand your chosen topics very well, it’s
                critical you are thorough with your concepts. Please revise beforehand and
                have material available for reference during sessions. </p>
            <p>
                In the <i>God-forbid-it-does-not-happen</i>
                scenario that you are not familiar with a
                concept or question posed by the student, please do not try and offer a halfbaked
                answer in any situation. Any such sessions reported to us by students will result in
                the equivalent of a two-star rating and you will not be paid for the session.</p>
            <p>
                Know your topics, do a good job, help others, earn money.</p>

        <section class="content-block">
            <h2 class="smallerheader">2. Communication</h2>
            <p>Do not be too casual with your language or words. Be professional
                and courteous. Take your session seriously. It can go a long way in ensuring your
                position as a much sought-after tutor on HashLearn.</p>

        <section class="content-block">

            <p>Practice makes perfect and can help improve your responsiveness
                in chat sessions. A very good grasp of subject knowledge, related tips and
                techniques is essential ensures you are on top of your game.</p>

        To complete your application as a tutor on HashLearn, you need to clear three phases of onboarding.

                Phase 1:

                    </span>
                This requires the applicant (you) to take a short test to gauge your understanding of the HashLearn
        policies and communication skills.</div>

                Phase 2:
                            </span>
                This requires the applicant (you) to provide us your ID Proof, Bank and PAN details.

                Phase 3:
                            </span>
                This phase requires the applicant (you) to give academic tests based on your choice. If you pass the
        test, you can then select topics for that exam to tutor on. Once this is done, a HashLearn training executive
        will get in touch with you shortly to complete the onboarding process.
